Linux system administration involves managing and maintaining Linux-based systems, including installing, configuring, securing, and troubleshooting various components. Given your strong background in IT, DevOps, and Linux, you might already be familiar with many aspects of system administration.

#### Syntax of Command
In the context of command-line interfaces (CLI), such as the terminal in Linux or Unix systems, commands, options, and arguments are key components used to interact with the system. A command has `three` parts;

**Command:** A command is a program or utility that you run in the terminal to perform a task.

**Options:** It (sometimes called "flags" or "switches") modify the behavior of a command. They usually start with one or two dashes (- or --), and they can enable or disable certain features or provide additional instructions to the command.

**Arguments:** Arguments are the files, directories, or other inputs that the command operates on. In many cases, arguments specify what the command should act upon.

**Key Notes**
- Command - `ls`, `cp`, `grep` - compulsory
- Options - `-r`, `-l`, `--help` - optional and 
- Arguments - `/home/user/`, `file.txt` - optional
